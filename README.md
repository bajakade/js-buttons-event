# js-buttons-event

We lay out buttons inside a div and modify their labels after each click event on one of the buttons.
#Styling. The document's elements must have the following styles:

The width of btns is 75%, relative to the document body's width.
Each button (i.e., btn1 through btn9) satisfies the following:
  The width is 30%, relative to its container width.
  The height is 48px.
  he font-size is 24px.
  
#Behavior. Each time btn5 is clicked, the innerHTML text on the grid's outer buttons (i.e., bt1, btn2, btn3, btn4, btn6, btn7, btn8, btn9) must rotate in the clockwise direction. Do not update the button id's.
